# Introduction

goals:
- make data-driven recommendations based on Peekbank for data analysis strategies that maximize reliability
(- and validity? Would require incorporating some independent data/ trying to configure CDI pipeline)

We consider three commonly used dependent variables:
- accuracy (average accuracy within a fixed window)
- baseline-corrected accuracy (average accuracy subtracting an average baseline)
- reaction time (ms)

Core question is how to make decisions within the processing pipeline that maximize key measure characteristics for these commonly used dependent variables.
- exclusions
-- missing data on a trial level
-- missing data on a participant level
-- other exclusion criteria
- window size
- how to handle "sticky" trials/ zoners

Setup each recommendation:
- What window should you use?
- How to decide when to include trials and participants
- whether to do baseline corrections
- how to compute the most reliable reaction times
- how to get the most stable estimates of accuracy and reaction time for individuals


# Dataset and appraoch

Subset of peekbank that we are using

Descriptives on datasets/number of trials

Illustrate the ICC approach to reliability 

# Results

Recommendation 1: To maximize reliability, choose long time windows.

Recommendation 2: [recommendation about how to set missingness criteria & how to deal with zoners - probably err on the side of including more data?]
- how many trials?
- how much data per trial?
- zoning trials + zoning trials

Recommendation 3: 

Recommendation 4: 

# Discussion

- Validity questions - recommendations towards what we should do as a field to validate these measures
